    # A while loop in Python executes a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true.
# It is ideal for situations where the number of repetitions is not known ahead of time, such as waiting for user input or for a condition to change


# while (condition):
    # block of code

# count=0
# while count<10:
#     count=count+1
#     print(count)


# while True:
#     age =int(input('enter your age'))
#     if age>18:
#         weight=float((input("enter your weight")))
#         print()
#         if weight>=50:
#             print("you are able")
#         else:
#             print("you are not able")
#         break


# guess number and count how many time enter number to guess right number


# value=7
# guess=0
#
# while True:
#     number = int(input("enter a number"))
#     guess=guess+1
#     if number==value:
#         print("correct")
#         break
#     elif number<value:
